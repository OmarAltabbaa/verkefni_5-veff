    <p><strong>Inheld</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>¼ cup vegan margarine (50 g)</li>
<li>½ cup soy milk (120 mL)</li>
<li>2 tablespoons sunflower oil, plus 1 litre (4 cups) extra for frying</li>
<li>2 cups plain flour (250 g)</li>
<li>½ cup caster sugar (100 g)</li>
<li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
<li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
</ul>

<li><p>Gently melt the butter over a low-medium heat. Add milk and 2 tablespoons of sunflower oil and mix together. Once combined, take     off the heat and set aside.</p></li>
<li><p>In a separate bowl, combine the flour, half of the sugar, baking powder and salt with a fork. Make a well in the centre.</p></li>
<li><p>Pour the butter mixture into the well. Combine gradually until a thick dough forms.</p></li>
<li><p>Using your hands, roll dough into little flat balls and with your thumb, press a hole in the centre of each doughnut. (You may       need to flour your hands for this part to avoid getting sticky!)</p></li>
<li><p>Heat up the litre of oil in a pan. To know when it's hot enough, fry a little bit of bread in the oil. If it goes brown and          floats to the top, in 45-50 seconds the oil will be ready!</p></li>
<li><p>Gently lay the doughnuts into the oil using a spatula. Fry for about 3-5 minutes on each side, until golden brown.</p></li>
<li><p>Transfer the doughnuts onto some tissue paper to soak up any excess oil. Then roll into a bowl of the remaining sugar.</p></li>
